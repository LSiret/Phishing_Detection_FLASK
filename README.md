To run the program, ensure all the used python libraries are installed by running the following commands in command prompt:

-> pip install flask; scikit-learn; email_validator; requests; joblib; pypdf2

If you open the python file in an IDE such as vscode, any other imports that are not installed should be underlined - install them using "pip install {package}".
Once these are all installed, simply run "app.py" in your IDE ensuring all the files are in the hierarchy, then open the web link that appears in the terminal.
