To run the program, ensure all the used python libraries are installed by running the following commands in command prompt:

-> pip install scikit-learn

-> pip install PyPDF2

-> pip install joblib

-> pip install flask

-> pip install email_validator

-> pip install requests

If you open the python file in an IDE such as vscode, any other imports that are not installed should be underlined - install them using the same format as seen above.
Once these are all installed, simply run "app.py" in your IDE ensuring all the files are in the hierarchy, then open the web link that appears in the terminal.
