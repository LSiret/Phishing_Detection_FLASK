To run the program, ensure all the used python libraries are installed by running the following command in command prompt:

-> pip install flask; scikit-learn; email_validator; requests; joblib; pypdf2

If you open the python file in an IDE such as vscode, any other imports that are not installed should be underlined - install them using "pip install {package}".
Once these are all installed, simply run "app.py" in your IDE ensuring all the files are in the hierarchy, then open the web link that appears in the terminal.

To use the LLM features, open "app.py" and change the Authorization token placeholder to a valid huggingface API token:
